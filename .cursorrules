# Markdown Notes – Cursor Rules

- **Stack:** TypeScript only; pnpm for package management; Tailwind CSS for styling; Prettier + ESLint (no conflicting formatters).
- **Database:** Neon (serverless Postgres). Use `@neondatabase/serverless` or a TypeScript ORM (e.g. Drizzle) compatible with Neon.
- **Environment:** All environment variables are managed with Doppler. Use `doppler run -- <command>` for any script that needs env. Do not add `.env` or `.env.local` to the repo; document Doppler in README.
- **No Vercel/Next.js:** Frontend is Vite + React; backend is Express. Do not use Next.js or Vercel.
- **Style:** Minimalistic UI—clean layout, limited palette; Tailwind utility classes only.
- **Conventions:** Functional components; clear separation between client (Vite/React) and server (Express); keep components small.
- **Markdown:** Notes stored and edited as markdown; render to HTML for display (e.g. `react-markdown`).
- **Auth:** Username/password (form-based login); user-scoped notes; session or JWT; protect API and UI. Store only password hashes (e.g. bcrypt).
